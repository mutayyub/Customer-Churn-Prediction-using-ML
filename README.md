# Customer-Churn-Prediction-using-ML

Predicting whether a customer will **stay or leave (churn)** is a key challenge for businesses.  
In this project, I'll build a machine learning model to analyze customer data and predict churn.

## Dataset

* **Size:** 64,374 rows and 12 columns.
* **Target Variable:** `Churn` (1 = churned, 0 = stayed)
* **Key Features:** Usage Frequency, Total Spend, Last Interaction, etc.
* Removed **Payment Delay** column due to **data leakage** (causing unrealistic 100% accuracy).
* **Dataset**: [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhammadshahidazeem/customer-churn-dataset/data)

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

We explored the dataset using the **four key pillars of EDA**:

1. **Composition**

   * Around *46.2%* of customers churned while the rest stayed.

2. **Distribution**

   * Features are fairly spread out, with no extreme skew.

3. **Comparison**

   * Churned customers generally had **lower usage frequency** and **lower spending** compared to retained customers.
   * Customers with **longer tenure** were less likely to churn.

4. **Correlation**

   * Overall, correlations were weak.
   * **Usage Frequency** and **Total Spend** show a slight *negative correlation* with churn.
   * **Age**, **Support Calls**, and **Tenure** had very small *positive correlations* with churn, but not strong enough to be key predictors.

## Models Used

We trained and evaluated several machine learning models:

* Logistic Regression
* Support Vector Classifier
* KNeighbors Classifier
* Decision Tree, Random Forest
* Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost
* XGBoost     ---------->     âœ… (Best Model)
* CatBoost

## Results

* After hyperparameter tuning, the **XGBoost Classifier** performed the best. (As per my available resources and computational power)
* **Accuracy:** 78.5% on the test set.
* Feature importance analysis showed that usage patterns and spending were the strongest predictors of churn.

## Key Insights

* Customers with **high engagement and spending are less likely to churn**.
* The model can help businesses **identify at-risk customers** and **design targeted retention strategies**.

## ðŸ“Œ Final Step

* Deploy as a **web app** on Streamlit for real-world usage.
